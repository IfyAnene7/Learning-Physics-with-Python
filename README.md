# Motivation

* Improving the Secondary education experience (in Nigeria) using programming tools and platforms such as github, python, overleaf/LaTex, & R Markdown.  

* Making Programming more inclusive for students with minimal opportunities/funding. 

* Increasing the amount girls and women involved in STEM.  


# Application and some of my thought process. 

* This is a heavily practice based learning environment. 

* Access to the solutions of exercises are dependent on two things (for now); the amount of time spent practicing the questions and not making progress, and inputing an answer with the answer being within a specific range of the solution. 

* Decided to start with the cambridge IGCSE Syllabus as my base. I intend to iteratively improve this and tailor it to the Nigerian student population's needs. 

* Add this to the collaboration section: If you intend on contributing and you have no idea where to get inspiration/content from, might I suggenst looking at these textbooks

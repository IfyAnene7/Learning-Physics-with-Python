    "* The sections of this chapter are listed in the lecture outline above. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In each section, I will introduce a roadmap of what you will be learning (i.e learning objective(s) of each section). Once you're done with the section and confident you have understood **ALL** the learning objective(s) for that section, you can attempt the tutorial related to that section.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I am assuming you have done most of the readings in lectures and spare time so I don't plan on going into detail of the theoretical aspects. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, your learning experience can only be improved if I know what to work on/change, that's why feedback is extremely **IMPORTANT**. Please **DON'T** hesitate to give feedback by sending an email to one of these:\n",
